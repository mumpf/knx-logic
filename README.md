knx-logic
===

Impelemtation of an 80 channel knx logic module based on the [knx stack](https://github.com/thelsing/knx) from thelsing.

It supports the SAMD version of the stack. Currently it uses my fork of the [knx stack](https://github.com/mumpf/knx), this will change in future.

It is a PlatformIO project and needs a working ETS 5.6 (or higher) installed on the same PC.

Currently this is not running standalone and is used by my [knx-sensor](https://github.com/mumpf/knx-sensor)-Project.
